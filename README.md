Therapist AI Game – HackFest 3.0 (Forked)
This is a forked copy of our group project for HackFest 3.0, built in collaboration with three amazing teammates over an intense 3-day sprint.

"Bot & Breathe" is a creative AI-based mental health simulation game where users act as therapists to emotionally unstable AI patients. Each character has unique psychological challenges like paranoia, jealousy, or digital depression, and the app is powered by Groq's Llama 3.1 8B model for real-time responses.

I’m proud to have been a part of this team effort — we tackled UI/UX, backend logic, and AI integration under serious time pressure and brought a fully working project to life.

✨ This fork exists for portfolio and reference purposes. All credits to the original team effort!
